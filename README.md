Game, Part 1: Project Plan
By Chinmay Patwardhan (chinnychin19)


Name of the Game: Stairway to Heaven
Origin: I first thought of popular song titles and tried to design games that fit to the same title.
I think this title is self explanatory if you read the goal and mechanics below.

Genre: 2-D side scrolling platformer

Goal: Reach the entrance to heaven and build a stairway to heaven's gates before being capture by the trailing darkness.
The user wins if they reach heaven's gates, and loses if they are sent to hell.

Mechanics: The user will be able to move right, move left, and jump (gravity is present). The games is broken into two stages as follows.

	Stage 1:
		The user starts at the center of the screen and "darkness" starts at the far left.
		Darkness slowly moves toward the right and the user should move right to keep ahead of the darkness.
		The user is able to move more quickly than the darkness, but the user has to get around obstacles:
			- Holes in the earth (user must jump over or fall to hell)
			- Pillars (user must jump over)
			- Fireballs falling from above (collision will send the user to hell)
		If darkness overtakes the user, the user will also be sent to hell.
		The user must also attempt to pick up as many "blocks" as possible along the way.
		There will be two types of blocks: temporary and permanent
		The blocks will be used at the base of heaven to build a stairway when the user arrives at this stage.
		
	Stage 2:
		When the user reaches the base of heaven, the side scrolling will end.
		The user will place the blocks strategically to build a stairway to heaven.
		Then a short timer will begin and the user will need to jump from block to block to reach the entrance to heaven.
		If a user lands on a temporary block, it will disappear after a short time interval.
		If the timer runs out, the user will be sent to hell because they are unworthy.
